<i><b><font size="5">S</font></b></i>ubrata De of Jamshedpur (Jharkhand-India) was initiated in the art of playing Hindustani Classical Music - Sitar at the tender age of seven under the guidance of <b>Shri Amarjeet Singh</b> of Jamshedpur and later on obtained training from <b>Suramani Bauri Bandhu Sethi</b> of Bhubaneswar, Orissa from where he has imbibed the essential elements of Sitar with great devotion and after 10 years he placed himself in the hands of Sitar Maestro <b>Pandit Manilal Nag</b> of Calcutta of Vishnupur Gharana, with strict discipline and sincerity ,to learn extensively the Dhrupad and Vadan Style(Gayaki), Tankari, Alapang, Gatkari etc. of Vishnupur Gharana and now has become an accomplished sitar player .His Father <b>Shri Bhutnath De</b> is also an eminent vocalist of Hindustani Classical Music. Now, Subrata is involved with various musical organisations as a lecturer in Sitar.

<br/><br/>

God's blessing and it may sound incredible, he has always kept his head bowed. Indian music is an ocean, and he thinks he is tinier than a drop. He realises that he exists because of the subject. 

<br/><br/>

<i><b><font size="5">S</font></b></i>ubrata's Music is spontaneous expression of powerful emotions and his deep knowledge of the Sitar. Subrata's style retains the depth, resonance and sensitivity of "Sur" in Alap as well as laying stress on the subtle and lilting phrasing of the Jhala. Through this combination, he brings to perfection the delicacy and sentimental mood of every Raga. He is a master of improvisation and possesses the rare ability to breathe life and originality into a classical theme, thereby molding it into a living and captivating form. The outstanding qualities of Subrata's performances are his maturity, incredibly sweet and melodious presentation of his instrument, and his imaginative development in the true form of Vishnupur Gharana.

<i><b><font size="5">G</font></b></i>harana - The Vishnupur Gharana meant essentially a Dhrupad Gharana, which originated in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of Bengal (now West Bengal) about 300 years ago and has its roots in the "Senia Gharana". Ustad Bahadur Khan, descendent of Miyan Tansen came to Vishnupur at the invitation of Malla King Raghunath Singh Bahadur of Vishnupur (also spelled as bishnupur). From that time onwards Vishnupur became a famous  of learning both Dhrupad music in the vocal and instrumental forms. Vishnupur was essentially a centre for dhrupad culture. The founding and expansion of this gharana was an event of great significance in the development of music in Bengal as it helped in expanding the culture of dhrupad in Bengal. The dhrupad of the Vishnupur gharana uses shuddha dhaivata in raga vasanta, a touch of komal nisada in the descending notes of bhairava. It has abandoned kadi madhyam in ramakeli, and uses suddha dhaivata in puravi and komal nisad in vehaga. It has also developed its own character with regard to rhythm.
